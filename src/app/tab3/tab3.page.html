          <h2>The Observation</h2>         
          I was always puzzled how we at the Swiss government fail to <i>retain</i> performing IT staff. 
          It angers me that not just innovators and cracks, but also the average Joe quits his employment to return as a
          high-waged<sup>1</sup> consultants at another federal org unit. 
          It's a reoccuring pattern and it is... let's say, unfavourable for the federal government, employees and tax payers.<sup>2</sup>.

          Find below the dilemma reported by Swiss National Television SRF.<br />

        <h2>An Utopian Proposal</h2>
          <p>
          I assume we fail to compensate adequatley. <i>Adequate</i> is subjective? Not necessarily. An environment where there is no common 
          understanding why one salary is higher than an other, baits misunderstanding, makes workers feel treated biased. Subsequently, 
          if we don't bring arguments and salary rule sets to the surface
          we can NOT expect a common understanding. If employees with lower salary cannot understand why their salary is composed to a lower salary than
          the one from a comparable collegue, discontent will arise and resistance will sprout. 
          Despite transparency ask for a cumbersome and high explenatory effort of leaders, it's worth it.
          <br />
          It also offers to let go of employees that grumble and moan for neglectable loan differences of a few pennies. This group will NOT perform, 
          not even after a salary rise or adjustment. It's a chance to let go of them, while there is a chance to <i>retain</i> the performers
          and maybe come to an agreement after understanding THEIR perspectives. And yes, I have seen strong wage-limits breach after calm discussions, 
          where solid work over years proceeded the negoiation - or let's say the exchange of perspectives and in the pursuit of a solution.
        </p>
        <p>Until lower, middle and top level management doesn't emphasize, I'll continue my passive protest with irony.</p>

        <h2>Don't feel offended</h2>
        <p>After all, my protest is neither meant personal nor targets individuals of consultants nor management. It merely trails my enduring hope
          of finding a contemporary way for the government and inspiring knowledge workers to persist as a team. 
          All for Operational Excellence, so that most tax payers more likely share the feeling that their tax money is well invested.</p>

            1) If you are a consultant, don't come up with the counter saying <i>Yes, but we have lots of expenses!</i>
            We have done the math many times. I suggest we skip it and can consiliantly agree that most of consultants are royaly rewared for your service
            in merely a different suit.
          <br />
            2) If you ask me in provocation but legit: <i>So, why are you not a consultant then?!</i> Yes, because I like the comfort and the feeling of security. Paying my mortgage and running after contracts. 
            And I think the government pays a fair - in most cases. I don't want to constantly ask others for more. Moderation is virtue, not a handicap.
            And btw, the Swiss government turned into a modern employeer that in many aspects values the performance of their experts.
